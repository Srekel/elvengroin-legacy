### Unprocessed Cheese Puffs

It seems, when you go to the snack shelves in a grocery store, there are a few categories. Generally the largest will be potato chips, but there are also flavored nuts, pretzels or the like, maybe something exotic, and cheese puffs.

Now, cheese puffs strike me as one of those inventions that we didn't necessarily had to make, had to invent. Now, I love my puffs. But if they hadn't been invented when they were (or discovered, as wikipedia alludes to), how long would it have taken for someone to do it? Maybe cheese puffs basically poof into existence as a result of many different processes and they'd been discovered very soon thereafter. 

But maybe they wouldn't have. 

Then we'd have very similar shelves, but one category would be missing. I imagine this would have been what snack shelves were like in the early 1930's. There'd be potato chips and nuts almost certainly, pretzels were invented a thousand years ago, so why not them too. But no cheese puffs.

And crucially... No-one would stand there going.. *"I feel like there's something missing"*.

Now we're starting to get close to my point. 

What if... we have yet to invent the next **category of snack**. Maybe there's one in the future that we easily **could** already produce, that we already have all the ingredients for, and it's tasty enough to steal half the shelf space of cheese puffs? We wouldn't know it now but it would be clear as day in... ten years?

That's a bit mind boggling to me.

Now, The Elvengroin Legacy is not a new category of games, a new genre. But my intent is to invent new mechanics, new features, new possibilities that no-one else has done. I think there are two main games that it will be compared to - Daggerfall, and to some extent, Caves of Cud. But I fully believe this design space is both large enough, and unexplored enough, that there are entire categories of mechanics that haven't been attempted in a real game (and by that I mean, not a tech demo, not in an academic paper, not as a proof of concept).

Here are a few guidelines I'll be using to guide me to find these cheese puffs of game desn:
 * Abstractions must be transparent
 * World must be concrete
 * Simulation builds gameplay
 * Feelings comes first
 * Balance comes last

My plan is to expand on these in future posts!
